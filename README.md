Team SEG's YUHacks2022 Submission

Hello there!

This was Team SEG's submission for the 2022 yuHacks hackathon.

DueBot description:

Students and people-in-general have a hard time keeping themselves organized and on task. Our new software solution, the DueBot, is a planning program that allows users to create and add tasks that they have to get done. Once complete, they can check off the task! This program is available on both a website and as a discord bot that they can install on their discord servers. The website and discord bot interact between each other to ensure that the list of tasks can be accessed from either platform. 

Our team placed 2nd out of a participation pool of 125 people.
